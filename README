This is a simple Linux-based command line tool for controlling the
(nice) 8-channel USB relay card from Velleman, model VM8090/K8090.

-- To build it, just use the provided Makefile to generate the "power"
executable.

-- To use it, in short:

Plug the USB cable of your relay card, an ACM serial device should appear. By default, this tool assumes /dev/ttyACM0, you can use the --device option to change this from the command line.

$ ./power --help
usage: power <options>, with:
--on=<relay-list>           turn relay(s) ON
--off[=<relay-list>]        turn relay(s) OFF (defaults to all)
--toggle[=<relay-list>]     toggle relay(s) (defaults to all)
--cycle=<relay-list>        power cycle relay(s)
--status=[<relay-list>]     get relay(s) status (defaults to all)
--firmware                  query firmware version
--debug                     dump serial traffic to stderr
--device=path               path to ACM device
--help                      this help
(relay-list: [1-8] or alias, [1-8]...)

-- Typical session

# power on relays 1 and 7
$ ./power --on=1,7

# cycle power on relay 7
$ ./power --cycle=7

# turn on 6 and turn off 2
$ ./power --on=6 --off=2

and so on.

-- Using aliases

Quite often, you will want to give nicknames to relays, depending on which board/hardware is being controlled by each relay. To this end, you can create aliases in the /etc/power directory. Each alias should be created as a symbolic link, with the link source mentioning the relay # (or list thereof), and the link target defined as the alias name, e.g.

$ ls -l /etc/power/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 sequoia -> 1 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 bf561 -> 2 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 quatro -> 3 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 phoenix -> 5 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 dm8148 -> 7 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 icecube -> 8

These aliases will be recognized and expanded to the actual relay number by the "power" command, when they appear in a relay list.

# e.g. turn on the ppc "icecube" board
$ ./power --on=icecube

You may also define group aliases, representing a list of relays, e.g.

$ ln -s 3,7 /etc/power/arm
$ ls -l /etc/power/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 15 19:14 arm -> 3,7 ...

Since each alias is processed recursively, you may mention another alias in any alias list, such as:

$ ln -s sequoia,phoenix,icecube, /etc/power/ppc

# get relay status for all arm and ppc boards $ ./power --status=arm,ppc
#1 => --
#3 => ON
#5 => --
#7 => ON
#8 => ON

This code does not provide any control for the relay timers or buttons.  It implements the required portions of the protocol described in the K8090/VM8090 Protocol Manual.
